        <h2>Hello, I'm George!</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a technologist, designer, and problem-solver currently pursuing my Master of Science 
            in Information Systems (MSIS) at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. I also 
            hold a B.S. in Computer Science from IU's Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            My professional journey has been shaped by three summer rotations at GE Appliances, where 
            I've worked as an Engineering Technician and Software Engineering Intern. I've contributed 
            to real-world embedded systems and user interfaces for appliances ‚Äî collaborating across C, 
            Lua, and JavaScript to create intuitive and reliable experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I see technology as both a creative and connective force ‚Äî one that can power smarter 
            systems, stronger communities, and more human-centered design. My goal is to keep building 
            those connections, one project at a time.

        My academic journey has provided me with a strong foundation in both technical 
        engineering and business strategy. The combination of computer science fundamentals 
        and information systems knowledge allows me to bridge the gap between technical 
        implementation and business value.
